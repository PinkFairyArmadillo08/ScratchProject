# ScratchProject

# The problem: 
People struggle to build sustainable habits and routines.

# Our solution: 
Using the habit loop (cue, habit, reward) our app will allow users to input individualized cues, habits, and rewards, then save the habits they are trying to build in their profile. Each day, our app will guide the user through these steps and help them build a lasting routine.
